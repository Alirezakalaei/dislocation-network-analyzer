# dislocation-network-analyzer
Automates the reconstruction of dislocation networks from the unordered segment lists generated by ParaDis simulations.
ation networks from unordered segment data, specifically designed for `.seg` files generated by the **ParaDis Dislocation Dynamics (DDD)** simulation software.

This project was developed at the University of Hong Kong.

## The Problem

Dislocation Dynamics simulation packages like ParaDis are powerful but often output the dislocation structure as a `.seg` file containing a list of independent, unordered segments. To perform analysis on continuous dislocation lines or to visualize the network correctly, these segments must first be connected and traced. This script automates that reconstruction process.

## Features

*   Reads dislocation segment data directly from ParaDis-generated `.seg` files.
*   **Reconstructs full, continuous dislocation lines** from the collection of unordered segments.
*   **Correctly identifies and handles junction points** where three or more segments meet, properly decomposing the network into a set of simple lines.
*   Visualizes the reconstructed 3D dislocation network using Matplotlib.
*   Saves the processed network data (a list of complete lines with their nodes, normals, and Burgers vectors) into a Python `pickle` file for easy downstream analysis.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.6+
*   NumPy
*   Matplotlib

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dislocation-network-analyzer.git
    ```
2.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

Run the script from your terminal, providing the path to your ParaDis `.seg` file as an argument.

```bash
python analyzer.py data/example.seg
